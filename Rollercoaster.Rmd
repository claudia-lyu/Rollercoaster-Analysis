#  Problem 1: How Tests Can Complement Graphical Comparisons, and Vice Versa (55 points)

In this problem, we will again work with the red wine dataset from Homework4. Here's the code to read in this dataset:
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
rollercoaster <- read.csv("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nolanbconaway/rollercoaster-tycoon-rides?resource=download&select=rollercoasters.csv")
```

As a reminder, help documentation for this dataset is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zjbranson/315Fall2022/master/wineQualityInfo.txt) for reference.
