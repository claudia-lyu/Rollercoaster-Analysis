# Rollercoaster Experience Analysis ðŸŽ¢  

This project explores the relationship between roller coaster characteristics â€” such as height, speed, and inversions â€” and ridersâ€™ overall experience and satisfaction.  
Conducted as part of *36-315: Statistical Graphics and Visualization* at Carnegie Mellon University, it demonstrates how data visualization can turn numerical data into actionable insights.  

## ðŸ“Š Key Highlights
- **Data Preparation:** Cleaned and transformed raw coaster data using R.  
- **Visualization:** Built exploratory plots with `ggplot2` to uncover trends across coaster height, speed, and ride smoothness.  
- **Analysis:** Applied correlation analysis and regression modeling to identify top predictors of excitement and safety perception.  
- **Outcome:** Created an interactive report that highlights optimal design balances between thrill and comfort.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Techniques
- **Language:** R  
- **Packages:** `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `corrplot`  
- **Files:**  
  - `Rollercoaster.Rmd` â€“ main R Markdown analysis file  
  - `RollerCoaster Tycoon Analysis of Coaster Construction.pdf` â€“ final report
